This is the `mingle-app/rn` React Native workspace.

- Root scripts (from `/Users/nam/mingle/mingle-app`):
- `pnpm rn:install`
- `pnpm rn:pods`
- `pnpm rn:start`
- `pnpm rn:ios:env-check`
- `pnpm rn:ios`
- `pnpm rn:android:env-check`
- `pnpm rn:android`

RN 앱은 아래 env를 필요로 합니다.

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_NAMESPACE` (iOS: `ios/v1.0.0`, Android: `android/v1.0.0`)
- `RN_CLIENT_VERSION` (optional, fallback: iOS `CFBundleShortVersionString`, Android `BuildConfig.MINGLE_CLIENT_VERSION`)
- `RN_CLIENT_BUILD` (optional, fallback: iOS `CFBundleVersion`, Android `BuildConfig.MINGLE_CLIENT_BUILD`)

RN WebView는 `apiNamespace` 쿼리로 웹에 전달합니다.
값이 없거나 플랫폼 기준값과 다르면 WebView를 로드하지 않고 오류를 표시합니다.
`pnpm rn:ios`는 실행 전에 `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_NAMESPACE=ios/v1.0.0`을 검증합니다.
`pnpm rn:android`는 실행 전에 `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_NAMESPACE=android/v1.0.0`을 검증합니다.

RN 앱은 시작 시 버전 정책 API를 호출해 `force_update | recommend_update | none`을 반영합니다.

- iOS: `/api/ios/v1.0.0/client/version-policy`
- Android: `/api/android/v1.0.0/client/version-policy`
- 요청 body에 `platform` (`ios` | `android`)를 포함합니다.

iOS 런타임 URL은 `Info.plist`의 아래 키를 우선 사용합니다.

- `MingleWebAppBaseURL`
- `MingleDefaultWsURL`

`scripts/devbox`는 iOS 디바이스 빌드 시 `rn/ios/devbox.runtime.xcconfig`를 생성/주입해
위 값을 워크트리/ngrok URL로 덮어씁니다. devbox를 쓰지 않는 일반 빌드는
Xcode 프로젝트 기본값(프로덕션 URL)을 사용합니다.

Android 런타임 URL과 namespace는 Gradle `BuildConfig`와 `NativeRuntimeConfigModule`로 주입됩니다.

This project was bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes — this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
